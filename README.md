# ELEC 221 2016W1 Project: Climate Change and The Antarctic Sea Ice Extent - Visual to Statistics

MATLAB code from my ELEC 221 Project, completed back in 2016. 

## ELEC 221: 2016W1

ELEC 221, Signals and Systems at UBC covers the following topics :

Complex numbers, LTI systems, convolution sum, discrete-time Fourier series and transforms, z-transform, sampling, introduction to filtering and modulation, feedback systems, stability.

The course had an optional project to be implemented in MATLAB, worth upto 10% of our final course grade. The project specification, report draft, and source code are available in this repository. 

## Notes

The code was slightly modified and refactored from the original version. The entire script has been separated into different files for modularity and easier disk management. 

## Files/Modules

* **ExtractFrames.m**: Extracts all the frames and relevant metadata from the video. The video has a total of 3081 frames, but for the purposes of this project, we will only need to work with frames 1359-1699 (in the project, I worked with frames 1363-1703)
